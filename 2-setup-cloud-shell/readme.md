# Lab 3 - Setup cloud shell (10 mins)

## Task 1: Configure the Cloud Shell 

In this task, you will configure Cloud Shell, then use Azure CLI to create a resource group and a virtual machine.  

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

    > __Note:__ 
    > These instructions presume that you have not previously used Cloud Shell. If you do not receive the prompts in steps 3 and 4, you have likely configured Cloud Shell already and should skip to Task 2.

2. From the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.
